# Welcome to Wordpress meets Composer

You can install this plugin from the [Wordpress-Plugin-Directory](https://plugins.wordpress.org/wp_talkToComposer) 
as any other wordpress-plugin.

It will create two files in your main wordpress-directory:

* composer.json Your main file that allows you to use composer 
* composer.lock The file that stores the actual version s of the plugins and themes you are using
